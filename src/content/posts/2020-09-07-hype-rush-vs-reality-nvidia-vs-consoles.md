In the past few days we have seen the impact of NVIDIA's announcement of RTX 3000 series release. Not only did it crash the highly related Cryptocurrency market, but it also created the biggest Hype Rush we have seen in years. In this post I will discuss on what is causing the hype, is the hype justified, what to look out for, and how not to fall into the hype train trap.



![Turing vs Ampere](/assets/nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-series-graphics-cards_announcement_geforce-rtx-3090_rtx-3080_rtx-3070_6-1030x579.png "RTX 2000 vs RTX 3000 series")



The hype is caused by NVIDIA delivering ( over-delivering might be right word here) exactly what they promised and more, by increasing the performance from previous generation by double. They compared two lineups of their High-End cards side by side, 2070 going against 3070 and 2080 going against 3080, and the numbers they got varied from 164% to 202% increase of performance depending on the card and game tested. Be wary, as the tests shown were only being done on **cherry picked** titles which NVIDIA knows will perform well on their newer gen of cards.

 All this sounds nice and might be overlooked for if the NVIDIA did what they did in previous generations, which was to increase the price each time the new gen was released, diminishing the real need for upgrade, and somewhat a desperate try to clean up the stocks of the previous generation cards. But, this time, they decided to keep the prices the same as the previous generation, and released the $499 model RTX 3070 for which they themselves claim has better performance compared to the previous Enthusiast level card RTX 2080 Ti that had $1199 + release price (some models were in the range of $1400-$1500 price point).

That's really great, the hype is justified! Right? -Short answer: **NO**, a bit longer answer:

NVIDIA knows what they are doing. They are rushing the market in order to collect as much revenue as possible before their competitors get the chance to respond. Their only competitor being AMD, this year NVIDIA had to be extra careful as AMD is coming from both fronts; consoles and Graphics cards.

It's no secret that AMD is responsible for making chips for both Xbox and PlayStation on their previous and upcoming gen consoles. Other than that AMD has it's own Graphics card lineup that is direct competitor to NVIDIA's product, and for this year, AMD announced that they will be releasing their next gen GPU's too, Big Navi (RDNA 2). RDNA 2 GPU architecture is the same one used in the next gen consoles, which are promising 4k 60fps gaming in the upcoming AAA titles. 

So, before rushing on the hype train and pre-ordering the RTX 3000 series, it would be wise to wait and see what the AMD and consoles have to offer. If you are to buy RTX 3070 for $500 or $600 only to find out later that a PS5 is only $400, with same gaming capabilities and comes in the whole package, or AMD released their RX 6000 series GPU for lower price but similar or better performance, both in games and production environment.

Look out for AMD next gen release, the console release price, and scavenge the used GPU market if you are looking for an upgrade. You can now find RTX 2080 Ti going for $450-$500, and some great cards like GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 go for $120-$200 now, which is an absolute steal.
