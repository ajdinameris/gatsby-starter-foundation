A terrible misfortune just struck those poor souls who mingle with Cryptocurrency trading (one of those souls is mine). We will be discussing on what happened, what should be done, how could it be predicted next time, and how to profit from this.

[NVIDIA announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E98hC9e__Xs&t=1964s) their 2nd gen Ray Tracing Graphics Cards, RTX 3000 series, on 1st of September 2020, and since the announcement the value of all mainstream Cryptocurrencies came crashing down, coming to a halt at the third day since the announcement. The loses were incredibly painful, as some have seen their portfolio value fall from 20% to 40% in mere 2 days, such falls unrecorded since grand burst of  Bitcoin bubble in December 2017.

**So how did this happen?** It's no secret that a big part of those who deal in Cryptocurrencies are Technology Enthusiasts (Cryptocurrency and Block-Chain being technologies themselves), so it's to be expected that they are likely to be interested in the latest and greatest of what NVIDIA has to offer. And oh boy did NVIDIA deliver. They broke the expected 20-40% performance increase which came with each new generation by showcasing 90-100% increase from last generation, and cutting the prices in order to stay competitive with consoles that are coming later this year. This prompted the mentioned Tech Enthusiasts to liquidize some of their portfolios so they can place a pre-orders on the upcoming Graphics Cards. Other traders saw the sudden spike in selling orders on their Cryptocurrency Trade Market, and in fear of missing out and being drained, they decided to liquidize too, causing chain reaction which lead to a 3 day constant value crash.

If you currently hold the Cryptocurrencies, don't sell, wait out on the drama, and the value will be back soon enough. The value already started coming back to "normal", as the chain of fear started to break, traders are coming back to their natural habitat.

All of this was actually predicted by my significant other couple months ago. We were talking about why she should try and invest into cryptocurrency, but her argument was that it was to volatile for her taste, as she can't trust a "bunch of kiddies" who are going to sell their Cryptos as soon as a new Graphics Card drops. And thus, her prediction came true several months later, at September 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. And, believe it or not, her prediction will hold true in the future releases too. We can expect the similar outcome when the AMD drops their announcement for the Big Navi RX 6000 series, or their new line of Ryzen processors.

**How to profit from this?** As you can imagine, those who predicted this outcome and sold their share of Cryptocurrencies as the announcement was dropped or before it, and came back today to buy it at significantly lower price, profited a large %percentage in just couple of days. Now that you know what caused this incident you can use that knowledge to your profit, and buy now while prices are low, and sell when the next announcement comes. Be prepared, and keep an eye on those announcements, or you can send me your email address and I can mail it to you not a moment too late.
