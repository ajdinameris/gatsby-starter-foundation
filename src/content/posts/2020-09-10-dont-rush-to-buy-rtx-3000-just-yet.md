So AMD just announced two upcoming events, one on 08.10.2020 where they will be revealing their 3rd gen Ryzen processors, and one on 28.10.2020 where they will reveal their long-awaited RDNA 2 GPU Architecture, new lineup of GPU's and their pricing range. 

This is a good news for the market, but I think it came a bit late, as the NVIDIA rushed in first and grabbed all of the Hype Rush for their upcoming RTX 3000 series. There is no stopping the pre orders and upcoming short supply of NVIDIA cards,  but I am here to convince at least one person not to rush, to put a diminishing return on NVIDIA's market dominion, and just wait and see what AMD has to offer.

First thing that surprised me here was that the AMD decided to host their CPU reveal event first. Intel being in their current state of failed engineering, where they are still dishing out their 14nm +++ architecture, poses no great deal of threat to AMD and their 7nm+ node (making the AMD CPU's more powerful per Watt spent, and less expensive at that). The obvious  choice here was to rush their GPU line so they can compete with their more fierce enemy, NVIDIA, but for some reason, they reasoned to let the market decide. 

![Rumor for Big Navi Pricing](/assets/amd-price.jpg "16 GB VRAM Big Navi card at $549 ")

There is a rumor, together with the picture above circulating on other tech blogs and social media that one of the staff members leaked the upcoming price to his associate in China. It shows that AMD is planing to release a Big Navi Card with whooping 72 SM (2x clusters of 36 Computing units) ad 16 GB of VRAM confirming that they will use GDDR6 over their HBM2 architecture. On the paper, raw performance expected in 4K gaming or rendering processes, puts this card in the middle of RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 (weighting in more towards RTX 3080 side), for only $50 over the RTX 3070. 

Maybe AMD will not be able to showcase something that could compete with NVIDIA's new Titan card RTX 3090, but we are sure to see that AMD will win in Price/Performance race where their Frames/$ number will be higher than their competitors. 

For the conclusion: If you plan on upgrading, or building a brand new PC, and you have been thinking about buying one of RTX 3000 series cards, wait a bit. Best case scenario, AMD will release better and cheaper cards. Worst case scenario, NVIDIA will drop prices to stay competitive. It's a win-win situation if you choose to wait. And don't forget, next gen consoles are close by, might be worth checking those out too if you in only for gaming.

Thanks for reading! :) If you have enjoyed it, you can send me an email at: biz.meris@gmail.com and I will be glad to reply as soon as possible.
