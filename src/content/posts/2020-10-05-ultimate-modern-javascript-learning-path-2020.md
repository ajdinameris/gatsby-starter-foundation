In the world of software development, one of the worst things that can happen to you is to be stuck into the tutorial hell. I was once there, endlessly shuffling through so many tutorials and guides, all of them similar in nature but all of them missing something that the other tutorial might have mentioned. This spirals you into a loop, searching for the last piece of the puzzle, while never knowing how big the puzzle is or how many pieces it has. So I have decided to make an **Ultimate guide to JavaScript learning path**. This path will keep you from falling into the tutorial hell like I did, and will also lower the risk of [](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/)[JavaScript Fatigue](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/). Be prepared for a long text, with few bad jokes here and there.

This guide is broken down in **4** (four) **sections** for easier consumption of the JavaScript learning path:

## Fundamentals

This section is for absolute beginners and is a must know if you plan on continuing the JavaScript path.

First thing you will have to know is how to **Run JavaScript**. Three things you will have to learn here are:

* HTML `<script>` tag
* Browser Console
* Link External file

### Variables

Next on the list are **Variables**. You need to learn what variables are, how to declare them, the scope of said variables, and what JavaScript hoisting means. Learning path for Variables is:

* Declarations

  * var
  * let
  * const
* Scope

  * Global
  * Function
  * Block
* Hoisting 



### Data Types and Data Structures

Once you have a solid understanding of variables, you then move on to learn Data Types and Data Structures. JavaScript is loosely typed, dynamic language, so variables are not directly associated with any particular data type. What that means is that any variable can be assigned a value of all data types. In JavaScript 9 (nine) **Data Types** are defined:

* Primitive types (can be checked using **typeof** operator)

  * undefined
  * Boolean
  * number
  * BigInt
  * String
  * Symbol
* null (Special primitive type)
* Complex types

  * Object
  * Function

Next on the list are built in JavaScript data structures. Theses **Data Structures** are:

* Array (starts with 0 :))
* Map / Weak Map
* Set / Weak Set
* Date



### Type Conversion 

Once you understand data types and structures, the next topic you will want to check out is type conversion. When writing code, you will find yourself having to convert data from one type to the other. 

You can convert it yourself using the methods that are available, like `boolean.toString()`, this is called **Explicit Type Conversion**.

The other type conversion is **Implicit Type Conversion**, this is when JavaScript itself converts the data type in order to be able to run the code you have written. 



### Equality

Learn the difference between **\==** and **\===** (the cause of many bugs when you are starting out with JavaScript)



### Loops

Next stop on the learning path are loops. You need to learn how to make them, break them and stick them into a stew (insert Samwise Gamgee meme). The things you will want to learn considering loops are: 

* while
* do...while
* for
* break/continue
* for...in
* for...of



### Control Flow

Now, you will learn the technology behind AI, and all those programmer jokes that got you into programming in the first place. Things that you'll have to learn here are:

* if...else
* switch
* try/catch/throw (statements for error handling)



### Expressions and Operators

Next thing on the learning path are the many operators that you will use in JavaScript. The list of operators is:

* Assignment Operator (The first operator that you will learn in JavaScript, used in assigning the data value to the variables \[first lesson])
* Arithmetic Operators
* Logical Operators
* Conditional Operator
* Comparison Operators
* Relational Operators
* Relational Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* String Operators
* Comma Operator
* Unary Operators



### Functions

The last fundamental topic to learn is functions. Things to learn here are:

* Function Declarations
* Function Expressions
* Calling Functions
* Parameters and Arguments
* Scope
* Arrow Functions



## Advanced 

First off, congratulations for making it this far! But, just knowing fundamentals in JavaScript won't get you far unfortunately. If you wish to learn some of those popular frameworks, libraries, etc... you will have to learn the Advanced section of JavaScript as well. 

### Advanced Scope

You will now continue where you left of in fundamentals, which is Functions and Scope. 

You will now learn about scope when dealing with nested functions, about lexical scoping, immediately invoked function expressions and the revealing module pattern. 

### Closure

Once you have a good understanding about scopes, you can then move unto the closures. A closure gives you access to an outer functions scope from an inner function.

### Currying

Once you know and understand closures, next good thing to know is function currying. One of advanced techniques that doesn't take that much time to learn.

### this (keyword)

A bit confusing subject in the world of JavaScript.  **this** keyword changes it's value depending where it is used. You can determine the value of **this** keyword using 5 (five) simple rules: 

* Implicit Binding
* Explicit Binding
* new Binding
* Lexical Binding
* Default Binding



### Prototype

Concept of prototype goes hand in hand with **this** keyword. You will learn that the every function in JavaScript has an object called prototype, which allows you to have shareable methods when creating instances of a function.

### Prototypal Inheritance

You will then learn about inheritance in JavaScript, which is possible because of the prototype and prototype chain.

### Class

Next on the learning list are classes in JavaScript. A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword `function` to initiate it, we use the keyword `class`, and the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method.

### Iterators and Generators

Iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of [`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loops.

### Event Loop

The must know topic for every JavaScript developer. The **event loop** is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

### Asynchronous JavaScript

Next thing to learn are traditional methods JavaScript has available for running the code asynchronously. Those methods are: 

* setTimeout
* setInterval
* callbacks
* Promises
* async await



### Module System

Last advanced topic in this section you will want to learn is about module system. You will learn how to split JavaScript code into different modules, which can then be exported and imported where needed. The topics to learn here are:

* CJS
* ESM
* Import / Export]
* Default and Named Exports



## Web APIs

These are the topics you need to learn along the Fundamental and Advanced sections of JavaScript. These are not the part of JavaScript language itself, rather they are build on top of the core JavaScript language. Topics to learn here are:

* DOM
* XHR and Fetch
* Storage
* Video and Audio
* Drawing Graphics
