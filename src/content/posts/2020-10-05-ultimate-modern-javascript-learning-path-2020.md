I was once there, endlessly shuffling through so many tutorials and guides, all of them similar in nature but all of them missing something that the other tutorial might have mentioned. This spirals you into a loop, searching for the last piece of the puzzle, while never knowing how big the puzzle is or how many pieces it has.
