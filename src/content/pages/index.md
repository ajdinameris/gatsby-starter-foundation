We are a small group of technology enthusiasts (just the two of us currently) who plan to grow together with this blog. Our next step is also an educational YouTube channel where we will be teaching our fields of expertise: Web Development | Graphic Design, and as we grow we hope to bring more educators in the fields of Game Development, Data Science, AI / Machine Learning, etc... so we can cover all relevant technology fields.



We will be implementing some changes soon, one of those first on the list being logging in and out (email/pass combo, Google, Facebook), and comments. What's a blog without comments and comment threads.
