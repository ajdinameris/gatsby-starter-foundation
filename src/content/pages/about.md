**Tesla Creative** is a group of young people with a big passion for sharing the knowledge and discussion in everything tech oriented, from coding, hardware, gaming, cryptocurrency etc... 

In the next few paragraphs I would like to explain what we do, why we do it, and what our plans are:

Currently our team only has two members, our Graphic Designer / Ajdina Sahovic, and I, Web Developer / Meris Tarhanis. 

This blog is our creation where we plan to write and store the articles on the current topics in the field of technology, and you might see more diverse genre of topics here compared to some other Blogs. Alas, that only means that there will be something for anyone, interested in any part of technology. 

Writing the articles here is only the first step, since we have 'a bit' of knowledge regarding Web Development / Graphic Design, we also plan on making Online Courses in both our respected fields of knowledge. 

Ajdina will be making courses teaching beginners to intermediaries into Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, After Effects ....), intro to 3D Modelling and Rendering, etc...

I will be teaching Web Development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React., Redux, Node.js,  Typescript, Express , and many more...

The goal will be to make portfolio worthy projects, with a bit of something that a lot of other online courses lack, but is key for student to fully grasp the lectures, tests. Every few key steps into the course, the test will be presented to the student. requiring him to recall what he learned previously and do the task (test) on his own, boosting his confidence and engraving the knowledge into his mind. 

Every Video series will be posted here, and will be discussed in details.



That is all for now in this About page, thank you for reading all this and take care :)
